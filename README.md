# Brewvolution overview

People brew for two main reasons; 
1. save some money, 
2. to make some good beer. 

In my short time brewing, I have heard a lot of opinions regarding the right way. This website is a way to quantify the benefits in metrics we can all understand, time, money, rating (0-10).

Brewing has so many variable, it would be nice to test some of them, and help other brewers know how to brew, and why we do certain things, with the information to choose what is right for them.

## Design brief

### Must haves;

* Logs brews that I have made, and rate them; overall taste, head retention, cost…
* Rating for extract kits, overall taste, head retention, cost…
* Rate extra fermentable (i.e. sugars), taste, head retention cost…
* Instructions for noobs in all aspect.
* Rating for methods and equipment, start-up cost (e.g. equipment cost), time (time is takes to use this method), pros and cons.

### Nice to have

* Live data feed from fermenters (bubble per hour, temps)
*	…

## Proposed experiments (Variables)

### 1.	Priming methods
##### Details
perfect time to write instructions for each of these methods
##### Methods;
1.	Carbonation drops
2.	Batch priming
3.	Using a measuring spoon and priming sugar
##### Metrics;
1.	Start-up cost (e.g. equipment)
2.	Cost per bottle
3.	Time
4.	Taste
5.	Head retention

### 2.	Temp control
##### Details
Perfect time to write instructions for temp control. I propose that this in carried out in May, as the temp will fluctuate but not exceed 20°C.
##### Methods;
1.	No – let the temp fluctuate 15 ± 5 °C
2.	Yes – 20°C
3.	Yes – another temp.
##### Metrics;
1.	Start-up cost (e.g. equipment)
2.	Cost per bottle
3.	Time
4.	Taste
5.	Head retention

### 3.	Water
##### Details
perfect time to write instructions for; filling the vessel with water using the extract can, tap water plus 24 hours + campden tablet.
##### Methods;
1.	Tap
2.	Tap + 24 hours and campden
3.	bottled
##### Metrics
1.	Start-up cost (e.g. equipment)
2.	Cost per bottle
3.	Time
4.	Taste
5.	Head retention

### 4.	Stirring
##### Details
perfect time to write instructions for starting brews
##### Methods;
1.	No stirring
2.	Yes – paddle mixer
3.	Yes – shake
##### Metrics
1.	Start-up cost (e.g. equipment)
2.	Cost per bottle
3.	Time
4.	Taste
5.	Head retention

### 5.	Sugar
##### Details
study into the effect on fermentable
##### Methods;
4.	Brew enhancer
5.	Brewing sugar
6.	Liquid malt extract
##### Metrics
6.	Start-up cost (e.g. equipment)
7.	Cost per bottle
8.	Time
9.	Taste
10.	Head retention
